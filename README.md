The csvReadIn.py file contains all the code required to set up
the featuresets used.

The PreliminaryResults.py file contains two sklearn regression models
providing baseline results for the two models

The linear_reg_two.py file contains a tensorflow linear regression model

The GaussianRegression.py file contains a tensorflow gaussian process
regression model.
